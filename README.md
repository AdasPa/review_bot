You have to have install python on your computer.
Also, you have to import on your computer several packages:
1. pillow
2. pyautogui
3. clipboard
4. time (probably imported by default)

To import packages you have to open cmd and type: pip install packagename
Common problem is "pip command not recognized" - then you have to add python and python\scripts to PATH.
